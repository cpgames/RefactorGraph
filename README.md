# RefactorGraph

Visual Studio extension for your craziest refactoring needs.  

## Concept:  

Refactor graph works by capturing the active document (or selection) and splitting it into a text chunks. Chunks can then be processed individually (using simple node-bassed logic) and combined back into a document output. You can also save your refactor graphs for using later (or in a different project) and run multiple refactor graphs synchronously on a single document.

Multi-document refactor is not supported currently (as there are still potential bugs, and would rather not mess up the entire project). But I will likely add it in the future once the code is more solid.
