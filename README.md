# RefactorGraph

Visual Studio extension for your craziest refactoring needs.  

## Concept:  

Refactor graph works by capturing the active document (or selection) and splitting it into a text chunks. Chunks can then be processed individually (using simple node-bassed logic) and combined back into a document output. You can also save your refactor graphs for using later (or in a different project) and run multiple refactor graphs synchronously on a single document.

Multi-document is not supported currently. But I will likely add it in the future.
